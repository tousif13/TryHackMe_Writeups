## Scenario - Investigate a potential C2 communication alert ( Task 2)

During normal SOC monitoring, Analyst John observed an alert on an IDS solution indicating a potential C2 communication from a user Browne from the HR department. A suspicious file was accessed containing a malicious pattern THM:{ ________ }. A week-long HTTP connection logs have been pulled to investigate. Due to limited resources, only the connection logs could be pulled out and are ingested into the connection_logs index in Kibana

### How many events were returned for the month of March 2022?

    1,482 hits
    
    In time filter, Give 'from' time as 1st March 2022 and 'to' time as 31st March 2022
    
    Update the search, we will get the events of the month of March 2022.

### What is the IP associated with the suspected user in the logs?

    192.166.65.54
    
    Click "Source_ip" from field types.
    
    We can see one IP is of 99.6% and other is 0.4%
    
    Thus, 0.4% IP is the suspected user as his hits are too minimal.

### What is the full URL of the C2 to which the infected host is connected?

    /yTg0Ah6a
    
    We need to find out full URL of C2. As we already knows the domain name (pastebin.com), we need to find the URI.
