# MAL: Malware Introductory

## Understanding Malware Campaigns (Task 2)

Two types : Targeted and Mass Campaign

### Targeted

A "Targeted" attack is just that - targeted. In most cases, malware attacks that occur this way are created for a specific purpose against a specific target. A great example of this type of purpose could be the DarkHotel malware, whom is designed to steal information such as authentication details from government officials.

### Mass Campaign

Mass Campaign classification can be akin to many real life examples, and is the most common type of attacks. The entire purpose of this type of Malware is to infect as many devices as possible and perform whatever it may - regardless of target.

### What is the famous example of a targeted attack-esque Malware that targeted Iran?

    Stuxnet
    
### What is the name of the Ransomware that used the Eternalblue exploit in a "Mass Campaign" attack?

    Wannacry
    
## Identifying if a Malware Attack has Happened (Task 3)

### Process of a malware attack

* Delivery
* Execution
* Maintaining Persistence
* Persistence
* Propagation

Two categories of fingerprints : Host Based and Network Based.

### Name the first essential step of a Malware Attack?

    Delivery
    
### Now name the second essential step of a Malware Attack?

    Execution
    
### What type of signature is used to classify remnants of infection on a host?

    Host-based signatures
    
### What is the name of the other classification of signature used after a Malware attack?

    Network-based signatures
    
## Static Vs. Dynamic Analysis (Task 4)

### Static Analysis

> "Static Analysis" is used to gain a high-level abstraction of the sample - it can be fairly simple to decide if a piece of code is "malicious" or not with this method alone. At its core, this method is of the analysis of the sample at the state it presents itself as, without executing the code. Employing the use of techniques such as signature analysis via checksums means quick, efficient (albeit extremely brief) and safe analysis of malware.

### Dynamic Analysis

> "Dynamic Analysis" essentially involves executing the sample and observing what happens.It is the testing and evaluation of an application by examining the code without executing the application.
