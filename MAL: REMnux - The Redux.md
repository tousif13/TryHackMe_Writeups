# MAL: REMnux - The Redux

Deploy the machine to perform the following tasks.

## Analysing Malicious PDF's (Task 3)

### Analyzing PDF's

PDF's are capable of containing many more types of code that can be executed without the user's
knowledge. This includes:
* Javascript
* Python
* Executables
* Powershell Shellcode

We'll be using `peepdf` to begin a precursory analysis of a PDF file to determine the presence of Javascript. If there is, we will extract this Javascript code (without executing it) for our inspection
