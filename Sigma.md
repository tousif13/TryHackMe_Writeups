# Sigma

> Sigma is an open-source generic signature language developed by Florian Roth & Thomas Patzke to describe log events in a structured format. This allows for quick sharing of detection methods by security analysts. It is mentioned that "Sigma is for log files as Snort is for network traffic, and Yara is for files."
